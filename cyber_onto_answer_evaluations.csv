","Pro-government groups use Trojanized apps on Facebook to infect users by posting links to these apps. They use social engineering techniques to entice users to download and run these apps, such as offering programs for encryption, antivirus protection, and firewall blocking. They also send messages via Skype and share posts on Facebook with links to download these apps. These apps contain Remote Administration Tool (RAT) Trojans, which allow the attackers to control the infected system remotely. The attackers use various RAT variants, including ShadowTech RAT, Xtreme RAT, NjRAT, Bitcomet RAT, Dark Comet RAT, and BlackShades RAT. The attackers continuously evolve their techniques and use different delivery options, such as hiding malicious files in "".scr"" containers to avoid detection by security solutions.","  Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a type of malware that allows attackers to remotely access and control a victim's computer. These trojans are typically delivered through phishing emails or drive-by downloads, where the user is tricked into downloading and running the malicious software. Once installed, the RAT provides the attacker with complete control over the victim's machine, allowing them to steal sensitive information, install additional malware, and even take control of the camera and microphone.  One way that pro-government groups use Trojanized apps on Facebook to infect users is by creating fake profiles and posting links to malicious apps on their walls. When users click on the link, they are redirected to a malicious website where they are prompted to download and install the app. The app appears to be legitimate, but in reality, it contains a hidden RAT that gives the attacker full control over the victim's device.  Another technique used by pro-government groups is to create fake news articles or videos that contain malicious links. These links may appear to lead to legitimate news sources or videos, but instead, they redirect the user to a malicious website where they are prompted to download and install the malicious app.  In addition to using Trojanized apps, pro-government groups also use phishing emails to infect users. These emails may appear to come from trusted sources such as banks or government agencies, and they may contain links to malicious websites or attachments that contain malware.  Overall, pro-government groups use a variety of techniques to infect users with RATs, including Trojanized apps, phishing emails, and fake news articles or videos.

They’re a criminal group focused on /uniFB01nancial gain. They are also one of the most aggressive threat actors in the landscape today. Countering their attacks is a challenge for defenders of small and large organizations alike. This report has a special section on them, including an analysis of what they do and how you can defend against them. \nOf course, they weren’t the only group in the mix. We also responded to \ncompromises from other criminal groups, state-aligned actors, and some groups that we don’t know enough about yet to characterize.\nAnswering this question of “who” is one of the things that Unit 42 Threat \nIntelligence is great at. We’ll keep researching and uncovering attackers wherever they try to hide. \nHow Do Threat Actors Get In?\nIn the past year, attackers’ initial access most often started with a software vulnerability. The largest attack campaigns began with successful exploitation of internet-facing systems. From there, the stories varied. \nNaturally, we also saw other techniques, from attackers using previously \nstolen credentials, phishing (both in email and chat), and more. \nBut don’t be misled–though phishing lost the top spot and dropped to \nnumber three, it’s still a serious threat. Attackers leverage phishing attacks for access, credentials, and tokens, rather than trying to drop malware. \nWhat Helped Threat Actors Succeed?\nThere were three security weaknesses that weren’t themselves the cause of incidents, but made attackers’ lives easier. Address these, and you’ll be helping yourself and hurting them.\n• Patch management. It’s only a matter of time. Unpatched \nvulnerabilities on internet-facing systems will be exploited. Measure and \nreduce your attack surface, and you’ll improve this.\n• Consistent coverage. Our incident responders found that \norganizations with partial or incomplete deployment of security controls (especially endpoint detection and response tools) allowed attackers to operate from parts of the network that weren’t defended. Deploy your defenses everywhere, and you’ll deny them this advantage.\n• Identity and access management. More attackers are stealing and \nusing the identity of authorized personnel to access and move around networks. Make that harder and embark on or continue a journey toward Zero Trust networking, and you’ll pressure attackers into making mistakes you can see.Actors, Methods and Targets\nSubscribe NowListen to Unit 42’s\nWhere we share unique \nthreat intelligence insights, \nnew threat actor TTPs,\nand real-world case studies']","  Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a type of malware that allows attackers to remotely access and control a victim's computer.

These are pragmatic, eﬀective approaches to counter emerging and evolving cyberthreats18Incident Response Report 2024\n18\nSpotlight On: Speed\nClearly, defenders need to speed up as much as possible. We’ll give more \nrecommendations for how to do that later in this report, but for the moment, there are a few key principles to keep in mind: \n•  Preparation. One of the best ways to get ahead of attackers is to truly get ahead. \nThrough proactive preparation, organizations can get ready to respond within hours to \ncompromises, stopping attackers before they have a chance to execute their plans.\n•  Automation. As we mentioned in the Black Basta example above, human security \nteams need to sleep, and they’re also typically pulled in many directions. Automation–especially when powered by machine learning and AI–can help defenders sift through alerts and surface the ones that truly need attention. \n•  Zero Trust. Another powerful way to limit the damage an attacker can do after \ncompromise is to limit their movement and activity. When organizations design their security posture in accordance with a Zero Trust philosophy, attackers become less powerful when they gain initial access, because initial access means much less. It’s the diﬀerence between a thief getting into an entryway and being able to move through the entire building, and a thief getting into the lobby only to encounter another locked door. \n•  Defense in depth. A security program designed with overlapping defenses and \ncontrols gives attackers more opportunity to alert you to their presence. Especially combined with limited privileges in a Zero Trust philosophy, you can raise the signal-to-noise ratio of meaningful alerts that will let you focus on attacker activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.']"," The systemic issues or mistakes made by defenders that contributed to attackers’ success include: 1.

","An attack is the use of an exploit(s) by an adversary to take advantage of a weakness(s) with the intent of achieving a negative technical impact(s). In September 2017, a supply chain attack occurred in which a software vendor distributed a legitimate software package known as CCleaner, but the binaries contained a Trojan backdoor that was signed with a valid certificate, giving users false confidence that the software they were using was secure. The actors behind this campaign were targeting major technology companies where the software was in use, either legitimately or as part of shadow IT."," An attack is a hostile action against a person or thing.

As the Cisco partner RSA discovered, supply chain \nattacks offer maximum impact for minimal effort on the part \nof criminalsAnother supply chain attack, which occurred in September \n2017, involved the download servers used by a software \nvendor to distribute a legitimate software package known \nas CCleaner.7 CCleaner’s binaries, which contained a Trojan \nbackdoor, were signed using a valid certificate, giving users \nfalse confidence that the software they were using was \nsecure. The actors behind this campaign were targeting major \ntechnology companies where the software was in use, either \nlegitimately or as part of shadow IT. \nSupply chain attacks appear to be increasing in velocity and \ncomplexity. They can impact computers on a massive scale, \nand can persist for months or even years. Defenders should \nbe aware of the potential risk of using software or hardware \nfrom organizations that do not have a responsible security \nposture. Look for vendors that issue CVEs, are quick to \naddress vulnerabilities, and consistently strive to ensure that \ntheir build systems can’t be compromisedWhat they need \nfrom security vendors is the “how”—that is, how to implement a \nlayered approach to value-chain security that includes elements \nsuch as physical security and cybersecurity standards.\nThe complexity of their networks means utility and energy \norganizations must also assess the impact of threat alerts, \nand decide which ones deserve mitigation resources. Nearly \nhalf of the utility and energy security professionals said \nof the thousands of daily alerts they see, only 63 percent \nof those alerts are investigated. Of the alerts that are \ninvestigated, 41 percent are deemed legitimate threats,  \nand 63 percent of those threats are remediated.\nFigure 68  Targeted attacks and APTs are  \nmost critical concerns\nDownload the 2017 graphics at: cisco.com/go/mcr2017graphicsSource: Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study42%40%Targeted\nAttacks\nAdvanced\nPersistent\nThreatsUtilitiesFigure 68  Targeted attacks and APTs \nare most critical concerns']"," An attack is a hostile action against a person or thing.
