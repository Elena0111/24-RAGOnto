","The life stages of salmon are summarized as follows:

Egg (Ova): the salmon begins life as a pea-sized egg, hidden under loose gravel in cool, clean rivers. Eggs have a high mortality rate, with only a small percentage surviving to hatch.

Alevin: upon hatching in spring, the fish are called alevins and have a yolk sac attached, providing nourishment. Once the yolk sac is absorbed, alevins become active, move through the gravel, and must gulp air to fill their swim bladders for neutral buoyancy.

Fry: they have eight fins and feed on microscopic invertebrates during summer; they are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.

Parr: in autumn, fry develop into parr; they have vertical stripes and spots for camouflage and they feed on aquatic insects, growing for 1-3 years while establishing territories in the stream.

Juvenile: young fish, mostly similar in form to adult but not yet sexually mature.

Smolt: once they reach 10-25 cm, parr undergo smolting; they become silvery and start swimming with the current, preparing for ocean migration.

Jack: precocial male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species.

Grilse (Adult Salmon): smolts migrated to the ocean that exhibit strong homing instincts to return to their river of origin to spawn.

Kelt: after spawning, salmon are referred to as kelts; weakened from not eating and the energy expended in reproduction, many kelts die."," The salmon life cycle consists of several stages, including egg, alevin, smolt, fry, adult, juvenile, parr, jack, grilse, and more. Each stage has unique characteristics and behaviors that help the salmon survive and thrive in its environment.  Egg: The egg stage begins when the female salmon releases her eggs into the water. The eggs are fertilized by the male salmon and then attach to rocks or other objects in the streambed. The eggs hatch after a few weeks, and the alevins emerge.  Alevin: The alevin stage is characterized by the presence of a yolk sac that provides nutrients to the developing fish. The alevins remain attached to the streambed until they absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming fry.  Smolt: The smolt stage occurs when the salmon transforms from a parr to a smolt. This transformation involves changes in coloration, behavior, and physiology that prepare the salmon for its journey to the ocean.  Fry: Fry are young salmon that have recently emerged from the gravel and are still dependent on their yolk sacs for nutrition. They are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.  Adult: Adult salmon are fully developed and capable of reproducing. They spend most of their lives in the ocean, returning to freshwater streams to spawn.  Juvenile: Juvenile salmon are young fish that have not yet reached sexual maturity. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Parr: Parr are young salmon that have not yet transformed into smolts. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Jack: Jacks are precocious male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species. They are smaller than other age classes of conspecifics and have unique coloration.  Grilse: Grilse are young Atlantic salmon that return to their native river to spawn for the first time after one winter at sea.  Overall, the salmon life cycle is complex and involves many stages that require specific adaptations and behaviors to ensure survival and successful reproduction.","['life history stage of salmonid fish:\nThe age class or life stage of the biological individual(s) at the time the occurrence was recorded.\negg:\nIn fish, the term egg usually refers to female haploid gametes.\nalevin:\nLarval salmon that have hatched but have not yet completely absorbed their yolk sacs and usually have not yet emerged from the gravel.\nsmolt:\n1) A young salmonid which has developed silvery coloring on its sides, obscuring the parr marks, and which is about to migrate or has just migrated into the sea, 2) to undergo the transformation from parr to smolt.\nfry:\nA young fish at the post-larval stage.

Alevin: The alevin stage is characterized by the presence of a yolk sac that provides nutrients to the developing fish. The alevins remain attached to the streambed until they absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming fry.  Smolt: The smolt stage occurs when the salmon transforms from a parr to a smolt. This transformation involves changes in coloration, behavior, and physiology that prepare the salmon for its journey to the ocean.  Fry: Fry are young salmon that have recently emerged from the gravel and are still dependent on their yolk sacs for nutrition. They are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.  Adult: Adult salmon are fully developed and capable of reproducing. They spend most of their lives in the ocean, returning to freshwater streams to spawn.  Juvenile: Juvenile salmon are young fish that have not yet reached sexual maturity. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Parr: Parr are young salmon that have not yet transformed into smolts. They are typically found in freshwater streams and rivers.  Jack: Jacks are precocious male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species. They are smaller than other age classes of conspecifics and have unique coloration.  Grilse: Grilse are young Atlantic salmon that return to their native river to spawn for the first time after one winter at sea.  Overall, the salmon life cycle is complex and involves many stages that require specific adaptations and behaviors to ensure survival and successful reproduction.",0.9999999999,0.9714285714285714,0.9613732329855204,1.0,0.0,0.9576910334323752,0.4999198049656765

Within Salmo, the Adriatic salmon (Salmo\nobtusirostris) and Black Sea salmon (Salmo labrax) have both been named as salmon in English, although they fall outside the generally recognized seven salmon species. The\nmasu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) is actually considered a trout (""cherry trout"") in Japan, with masu actually being the Japanese word for trout. On the other hand, the\nsteelhead and sea trout, the anadromous forms of rainbow trout and brown trout respectively, are from the same genera as salmon and live identical migratory lives, but\nneither is termed ""salmon"" .\nThe extinct Eosalmo driftwoode nsis, the oldest know n Salmoninae fish in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon\ndiverged from a common ancestor. The Eocene salmon\'s fossil from British Columbia provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic\nsalmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondr ial DNA suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20\nmillion years ago during the Miocene. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long\nbefore the Quaternary glaciation began the cycle of glacial advance and retreat.[33]\nThere are several other species of fish which are colloquially called ""salmon"" but are not true salmon. Of those listed below, the Danube  salmon or huchen is\na large freshwater salmonid closely related (from the same subfamily) to the seven species of salmon above , but others are fishes of unrelated orders, given\nthe common na me ""salmon"" simply due  to similar shapes, behaviors and niches occupied:Non-salmon species of ""salmon""pacific salmon:\nThere are five species of Pacific salmon, which occur in the North Pacific waters of the United States and Canada -- Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink, and Sockeye. All five species are anadromous, meaning that they spawn in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to forage and mature, and return to freshwater to spawn and begin the cycle again.\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.\noncorhynchus tshawytscha:\nOncorhynchus tshawytscha (i.e. Chinook salmon) is the largest of the five species of Pacific salmon.\n\nPhysical Description: The Chinook is blue-green, red, or purple on the back and top of the head, with silvery sides and white ventral surfaces. It has black spots on its tail and the upper half of its body. Although spots are seen on the tail in pink salmon, and silver on the tail in coho and chum salmon, Chinook are unique among the Pacific salmon in combining black spots and silver on the tail. Another distinctive feature is a black gum line that is present in both salt and freshwater. Adult fish range in size from 24 to 36 in (61 to 91 cm), but may be up to 58 in (150 cm) in length; they average 10 to 50 lb (4.5 to 22.7 kg), but may reach 130 lb (59 kg). The meat can be either pink or white in color, depending on what the salmon have been feeding on.\n\nRange: Chinook are anadromous fish native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in the Arctic northeast Siberia. They have been introduced to other parts of the world, including New Zealand, thriving in Lake Michigan Great Lakes of North America and Michigan\'s western rivers, and Patagonia.\noncorhynchus spp.:\nOncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek ὄγκος (ónkos, “lump, bend”) + ῥύγχος (rhúnkhos, “snout”), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the ""kype"").\nsalmonid type:\nIn biological taxonomy, Type generically refers to the official name applied to a taxon. This Class constrains Type members as belonging to family Salmonidae\noncorhynchus keta:\nThe class which contains all instances of Oncorhynchus keta.\noncorhynchus keta:\nOncorhynchus keta (i.e. chum salmon) is one of the five species of Pacific salmon.\n\nPhysical Description: The body of the chum salmon is deeper than most salmonid species. In common with other species found in the Pacific, the anal fin has 12 to 20 rays, compared with a maximum of 12 in European species. Chum have an ocean coloration of silvery blue green with some indistinct spotting in a darker shade, and a rather paler belly. When they move into fresh water the color changes to dark olive green and the belly color deepens. When adults are near spawning, they have purple blotchy streaks near the caudal peduncle, darker towards the tail. Spawning males typically grow an elongated snout or kype, their lower fins become tipped with white and they have enlarged teeth. Some researchers speculate these characteristics are used to compete for mates.\n\nRange: Chum salmon have the largest natural range of any Pacific salmon, and undergo the longest migrations within the genus Oncorhynchus, far up the Yukon River and deep into the Amur River basin in Asia. In lesser numbers they migrate thousands of kilometres up the Mackenzie River. Chum are found around the north Pacific, in the waters of Korea, Japan, and the Okhotsk and Bering seas (Kamchatka, Chukotka, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai), British Columbia in Canada, and from Alaska to California in the United States.

","The three key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes are standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release. Standing biomass categorized by size is the best short-term indicator, while standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release are good indicators for medium- and long-term harvest. Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates as it takes up to 2 years from smolt release to harvest. Variation in seawater temperature can impact the length of the production cycle and harvest volumes. A warmer winter can increase harvest volumes for the relevant year, partly at the expense of the subsequent year. Disease outbreaks can impact harvest volume due to mortality and growth slowdown."," The key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes include standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release. Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates by providing information about the number of fish released into the ocean, which can help predict future harvests.

"How do husbandry and health practices contribute to maximise salmon survival and fish stock maintenance?
These concepts might be useful to answer the question: 
","Maximising survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks are primarily achieved through good husbandry and health management practices and policies, which reduce exposure to pathogens and the risk of health challenges. The success of good health management practices has been demonstrated on many occasions and has contributed to an overall improvement in the survival of farmed salmonids. Fish health management plans, veterinary health plans, biosecurity plans, risk mitigation plans, contingency plans, disinfection procedures, surveillance schemes, as well as coordinated and synchronised zone/area management approaches, all support healthy stocks with an emphasis on disease prevention. Prevention of many diseases is achieved through vaccination at an early stage and while the salmon are in freshwater. Vaccines are widely used commercially to reduce the risk of health challenges. With the introduction of vaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have been effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of licensed medicines prescribed in the industry has been reduced. In some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and for the well-being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may have to use licensed medicines from time to time, if other measures are not sufficient.","  Husbandry and health practices play a crucial role in maximizing salmon survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks. Good husbandry practices include proper feeding, water quality management, and disease prevention measures. Health practices involve regular monitoring of fish health, timely diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and implementation of preventive measures such as vaccinations and biosecurity protocols. These practices help to minimize stress on the fish, reduce the risk of disease outbreaks, and ensure optimal growth and survival rates.
