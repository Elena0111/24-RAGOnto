Identify and describe the length measurement type used for tuna. What are the automatic methods used for tuna length measurement?,"The length measurement type used for tuna is fork length. Fork length is the distance from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail. It is the most commonly used length measurement type for tuna. Automatic methods used for tuna length measurement are Hough transform, image thinning, best fitting rectangle, Hsiu method and grade-3 polynomial regression. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Hough transform has a low error rate of less than 5%, while the Hsiu method has a high accuracy rate of measuring smaller fish lengths. However, these methods have not been widely used for tuna length measurement due to their limitations and challenges."," The length measurement type used for tuna is the Hough transform. This method uses a mathematical algorithm to detect lines and curves in images. It is commonly used in computer vision applications, including fish length measurement. To automatically measure the length of tuna, researchers have developed several methods. One popular method is the Hough transform, which is based on the principle of line detection. Another method is image thinning, which involves reducing the thickness of the image to a single pixel width. This makes it easier to identify the edges of the fish and calculate its length.

Summarize the salmon life-cycle's stages.,"The life stages of salmon are summarized as follows:

Egg (Ova): the salmon begins life as a pea-sized egg, hidden under loose gravel in cool, clean rivers. Eggs have a high mortality rate, with only a small percentage surviving to hatch.

Alevin: upon hatching in spring, the fish are called alevins and have a yolk sac attached, providing nourishment. Once the yolk sac is absorbed, alevins become active, move through the gravel, and must gulp air to fill their swim bladders for neutral buoyancy.

Fry: they have eight fins and feed on microscopic invertebrates during summer; they are typically found in shallow waters near the shoreline.

Parr: in autumn, fry develop into parr; they have vertical stripes and spots for camouflage and they feed on aquatic insects, growing for 1-3 years while establishing territories in the stream.

Juvenile: young fish, mostly similar in form to adult but not yet sexually mature.

Smolt: once they reach 10-25 cm, parr undergo smolting; they become silvery and start swimming with the current, preparing for ocean migration.

Jack: precocial male salmon that have spent one winter less in the ocean than the youngest females of a given species.

Grilse (Adult Salmon): smolts migrated to the ocean that exhibit strong homing instincts to return to their river of origin to spawn.

Kelt: after spawning, salmon are referred to as kelts; weakened from not eating and the energy expended in reproduction, many kelts die."," The salmon life cycle consists of various stages, including egg, alevin, fry, parr, smolt, and adult salmon. The salmon begins its life cycle as an egg, which is laid in the gravel of a river. After hatching, the alevin stage begins, where the young salmon absorbs its yolk sac and begins swimming upstream. During the fry stage, the salmon feeds on small invertebrates and grows until it reaches the parr stage. In the parr stage, the salmon develops vertical stripes and spots for camouflage and continues to grow until it reaches the smolt stage. The smolt stage is characterized by the salmon's ability to adapt to living in saltwater, and it migrates to the ocean to feed and grow. After spending one to three years in the ocean, the salmon returns to its home river to spawn, completing the life cycle.","['# Salmon Life Cycle\n\nSalmon are native to the world\'s two biggest oceans and the rivers draining\ninto them. The Atlantic Ocean has only one species, the Atlantic salmon\n_(Salmo salar),_ while in the Pacific Ocean there are several species\nincluding Pink _(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha_), Chum _(O. keta)_ , Sockeye _(O.\nnerka_), Coho _(O. kisutch_), Chinook _(O. tschawytscha_) and Amago _(O.\nrhodurus_).\n\n## **Life Cycle of Atlantic Salmon**\n\nIrish salmon are Atlantic salmon and spend their juvenile phase in rivers\nbefore migrating to sea to grow and mature. To complete their life cycle they\nmust return to their river of origin to spawn. The salmon who adopt this life\ncycle are called anadromous.\n\n### **Life begins**\n\nThe salmon starts life as a small pea sized egg hidden away under loose gravel\nin cool clean rivers entering the North Atlantic Ocean. Against the odds the\nparents of this little egg have succeeded in returning to freshwater to spawn\ncompleting their life cycle before giving rise to a new generation. To do this\nboth male and female adults ceased to feed on entering freshwater in response\nto gonadal development, directing all their energy instead to reproduction.\nThe migration of adults in winter to suitable habitat can commence up to a\nyear before spawning takes place. Spawning typically occurs in headwaters,\nthough it may happen anywhere in a river if a suitable substrate of well\noxygenated loose gravel is available. At spawning time (November to January),\nthe female digs a depression in the gravel with her tail to deposit her eggs.\nOne or more males discharge milt over the falling eggs to fertilize. Quickly\nthe female covers the eggs with gravel to a depth of several centimetres which\nforms a nest or ""redd"" on the river bed. Buried deep inside the gravel the ova\nare safe from the impact of debris carried along in heavy floods and from\nattack by predators such as eels (_Anguilla anguilla_), trout (_Salmo trutta_)\nor cormorants (_Phalacrocorax carbo)_.\n\n### **Ova**\n\nThe rate of egg or ""ova"" development is dependent on water temperature. Eyes\ninside the pea sized orange ova are visible and increasing movement can be\ndetected as the yolk sac containing food is consumed. The number of ova\ndeposited in the redd is determined by the size of the female with larger\nfemales over 10kg depositing 15,000 each. This high fecundity (ova per female)\nis critical as survival in the wild is extremely low, especially in\nfreshwater. For example, in the Burrishoole River on the west coast of Ireland\nsurvival rates for juveniles from 1970 to 2015 was as low as 0.3% in 2001\nrising to a high of just 1.3% in 2007.\n\n### **Alevins**\n\nThe just-hatched fish are called ""alevins"" and still have the yolk sac\nattached to their bodies in Spring. When their yolk sac is absorbed the\nalevins become increasingly active and begin their journey up through the\ngravel of the riverbed. When strong enough the small fish must rise to the\nsurface of the water and gulp air. By doing this they fill their swim bladder\nto gain neutral buoyancy making it easier to swim and hold their position in\nfast flowing streams. This critical period is therefore referred to as ""swim-\nup"" and exposes the young to dangerous predators for the first time. Once they\nbegin to swim freely they are called fry.\n\n### **Fry**\n\nThe fry have eight fins, which are used to maintain their position in fast\nflowing streams and manoeuvre about in the water during the Summer months. Fry\nfeed on microscopic invertebrates and their abundance is regulated by\ntemperature, predation, pollution and competition for food with other fry and\nother species of fish. The presence of salmon in a river is synonymous with a\nhealthy aquatic environment, and as they are extremely sensitive to changes in\nwater quality, habitat and climate, salmon are a good indicator of freshwater\nand marine ecosystem status.\n\n### **Parr**\n\nOver the Autumn the fry develop into parr with vertical stripes and spots for\ncamouflage. They feed on aquatic insects and continue to grow for one to three\nyears while maintaining their territory in the stream. Once the parr have\ngrown to between 10 and 25cm in body length, they undergo a physiological pre-\nadaptation to life in seawater by smolting. This is evident by changes in\ntheir appearance as they become silvery and swim with the current instead of\nagainst it. There are also internal changes in the salt-regulating mechanisms\nof the fish. This adaptation prepares the smolt for its journey to the ocean.\n\n### **Smolt**\n\nIn Spring, large numbers of smolts 1-3 years old, leave Irish rivers to\nmigrate along the North Atlantic Drift, and into the rich feeding grounds of\nthe Norwegian Sea and the greater expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. Here\nthey feed primarily on fish such as capelin _(Mallotus villosus)_ , herring\n_(Alosa spp.)_ , and sand eel _(_ Ammodytes spp _.)_. As they grow quickly\nfewer predators are able to feed on them. Their rate of growth is therefore\ncritical to survival.\n\n**Adult Salmon**\n\nSalmon that reach maturity after one year at sea are called Grilse; these\nreturn to their river in summer weighing from 0.8 to 4kg. If it takes two or\nmore years at sea to mature the salmon will return considerably earlier in the\nyear and larger at 3 to 15kg, and because of their size they are greatly\nsought after by fishermen. Salmon exhibit remarkable ""homing instinct"" with a\nvery high proportion able to locate their river of origin using the earth\'s\nmagnetic field, the chemical smell of their river and pheromones (chemical\nsubstances released by other salmon in the river). Perfect homing precision is\nexpected even after migrations over 3,000km to feeding grounds north of the\nArctic Circle in the Norwegian Sea and at West Greenland. There is great\nexcitement when adult salmon return to rivers as many are seen leaping\nacrobatically into the air and jumping over waterfalls while moving upstream.\nSalmon that survive fishermen, poachers and pollution may still have to scale\nlarge dams built across rivers before eventually finding refuge in lakes and\ndeep pools. Arriving upstream on their spawning grounds among big boulders in\nicy headwaters the life cycle begins again, so ensuring survival of the\nspecies for another generation.\n\n### **Kelts**\n\nHaving spawned, the salmon are referred to as ""kelts"". Weak from not eating\nsince arriving in freshwater and losing energy in a bid to reproduce\nsuccessfully, kelts are susceptible to disease and predators. Mortality after\nspawning can be significant, especially for males but some do survive and\ncommence their epic journey again. Scientists studying salmon initially used\nthe rings laid down on scales, much like tree rings, to determine the age and\ngrowth of salmon in freshwater and at sea. By doing this they established that\nsome kelts succeeded in spawning three times! Now a new record exists of an\nIrish salmon that reached maturity after less than one year at sea - a zero\nsea winter salmon']"," The salmon life cycle consists of various stages, including egg, alevin, fry, parr, smolt, and adult salmon.

What are the key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes? How does smolt release data affect long-term volume estimates? How does seawater temperature affect production cycle length and harvest volumes? How do disease outbreaks impact fish harvest volumes?,"The three key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes are standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release. Standing biomass categorized by size is the best short-term indicator, while standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release are good indicators for medium- and long-term harvest. Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates as it takes up to 2 years from smolt release to harvest. Variation in seawater temperature can impact the length of the production cycle and harvest volumes. A warmer winter can increase harvest volumes for the relevant year, partly at the expense of the subsequent year. Disease outbreaks can impact harvest volume due to mortality and growth slowdown."," The key indicators for projecting future fish harvest volumes include standing biomass, feed consumption, and smolt release. Smolt release data affects long-term volume estimates by providing information about the number of fish released into the ocean, which can help predict future harvests.

How do husbandry and health practices contribute to maximise salmon survival and fish stock maintenance?,"Maximising survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks are primarily achieved through good husbandry and health management practices and policies, which reduce exposure to pathogens and the risk of health challenges. The success of good health management practices has been demonstrated on many occasions and has contributed to an overall improvement in the survival of farmed salmonids. Fish health management plans, veterinary health plans, biosecurity plans, risk mitigation plans, contingency plans, disinfection procedures, surveillance schemes, as well as coordinated and synchronised zone/area management approaches, all support healthy stocks with an emphasis on disease prevention. Prevention of many diseases is achieved through vaccination at an early stage and while the salmon are in freshwater. Vaccines are widely used commercially to reduce the risk of health challenges. With the introduction of vaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have been effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of licensed medicines prescribed in the industry has been reduced. In some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and for the well-being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may have to use licensed medicines from time to time, if other measures are not sufficient.","  Husbandry and health practices play a crucial role in maximizing salmon survival and maintaining healthy fish stocks. Good husbandry practices include proper feeding, water quality management, and disease prevention measures.
