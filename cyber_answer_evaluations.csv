What are threat actors? How do they exploit Skype messages?,"Threat Actors are actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent. They use social engineering skills, such as the exploitation of Skype messages by sending malicious links or attachments that appear legitimate but they are usually sent from fake or compromised accounts. These links to download programs, like 'SSH VPN' or 'Ammazon Internet Security', can lead to the installation of malware on the victim's device, which can then be used to steal sensitive information or take control of the device.","  Threat actors are individuals or groups who engage in cyberattacks and other malicious activities on computer networks and systems. They use various methods to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, disrupt operations, or steal data. One way they exploit Skype messages is by sending malicious links or attachments that contain malware or viruses. When users click on these links or open the attachments, the malware can infect their devices and allow the threat actors to gain control over the system. This can lead to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other forms of cybercrime. To protect against such threats, it is important to be cautious when opening emails or messages from unknown sources and to use antivirus software and firewalls to prevent malware infections.","['How Do Threat Actors Get In?\nIn the past year, attackers’ initial access most often started with a software vulnerability.

Describe the Permanent Denial of Service attack (PDoS).,"Permanent denial of service (PDoS) attacks are rapid bot attacks that render device hardware non-functional, often requiring hardware reinstallation or replacement. These attacks, also known as ""phlashing,"" exploit security flaws to destroy firmware and system functions. The BrickerBot malware uses Telnet brute force to breach devices, corrupts storage with Linux commands, disrupts internet connectivity, and wipes all files on the device."," The Permanent Denial of Service attack (PDoS) is a type of cyber attack that aims to render a computer or network unavailable for an extended period of time. Unlike other types of DDoS attacks, which aim to overwhelm a target with traffic, PDoS attacks seek to corrupt or destroy the target's hardware or software. This can be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the target's operating system or firmware, or by sending malicious code that causes the target to crash or become unresponsive. PDoS attacks can have serious consequences, including data loss, financial losses, and disruption of critical services.

What are the systemic issues or mistakes made by defenders that contributed to attackers’ success?,"Systemic issues or mistakes by defenders that contribute to attackers' success include: 
- Lack of Preparation: Failing to proactively prepare for compromises results in delayed responses. 
- Insufficient Automation: Over-reliance on manual processes can lead to missed critical alerts and slower response times. 
- Weak Zero Trust Implementation: Not restricting attackers' movement after initial access allows them to cause more damage. 
- Inadequate Defense in Depth: Single-layer defenses without overlapping controls make it easier for attackers to navigate and compromise systems."," The systemic issues or mistakes made by defenders that contributed to attackers’ success include: 1. Lack of preparedness: Defenders often fail to prepare adequately for potential attacks, leaving them vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. 2. Slow response time: Defenders take too long to detect and respond to attacks, giving attackers ample time to carry out their malicious activities. 3. Insufficient resources: Defenders may not have enough resources to effectively monitor and protect their systems, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. 4. Poor communication: Defenders may not communicate effectively with each other or with external parties, leading to delays in incident response and increased risk of data breaches. 5. Inadequate training: Defenders may lack the necessary skills and knowledge to identify and respond to complex attacks, leaving them vulnerable to attackers who are better equipped. 6. Overconfidence: Defenders may underestimate the capabilities of attackers, leading to complacency and a false sense of security.

These are pragmatic, eﬀective approaches to counter emerging and evolving cyberthreats18Incident Response Report 2024\n18\nSpotlight On: Speed\nClearly, defenders need to speed up as much as possible. We’ll give more \nrecommendations for how to do that later in this report, but for the moment, there are a few key principles to keep in mind: \n•  Preparation. One of the best ways to get ahead of attackers is to truly get ahead. \nThrough proactive preparation, organizations can get ready to respond within hours to \ncompromises, stopping attackers before they have a chance to execute their plans.\n•  Automation. As we mentioned in the Black Basta example above, human security \nteams need to sleep, and they’re also typically pulled in many directions. Automation–especially when powered by machine learning and AI–can help defenders sift through alerts and surface the ones that truly need attention. \n•  Zero Trust. Another powerful way to limit the damage an attacker can do after \ncompromise is to limit their movement and activity. When organizations design their security posture in accordance with a Zero Trust philosophy, attackers become less powerful when they gain initial access, because initial access means much less. It’s the diﬀerence between a thief getting into an entryway and being able to move through the entire building, and a thief getting into the lobby only to encounter another locked door. \n•  Defense in depth. A security program designed with overlapping defenses and \ncontrols gives attackers more opportunity to alert you to their presence. Especially combined with limited privileges in a Zero Trust philosophy, you can raise the signal-to-noise ratio of meaningful alerts that will let you focus on attacker activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.']"," The systemic issues or mistakes made by defenders that contributed to attackers’ success include: 1.

However, the version of CCleaner that was released in September 2017 contained a backdoor that allowed hackers to gain access to the systems of users who installed the update.
